# babble-web

Live demo: https://aurabirb.github.io/babble-web/

Project Babble (https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble) but in the browser.

This does not send the tracker data to VRChat yet, and it will never support it without third-party software (such as an Websocket -> OSC bridge).

Nevertheless, it's useful for debugging and connecting your ESP32-S3 XIAO Sense board and testing the EyeTrackVR firmware or checking out Project Babble even without buying the hardware (because we support your regular webcam as an input source).

This project was vibe coded in a day, so don't expect any quality code.
